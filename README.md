# Final-Project-Tableau
- This dataset estimates the global prevalence and mortality of tuberculosis between 1990 and 2013. Option IV
  
- The dataset (a .csv) file has nine dimension values and 41 measures

- The datatypes include strings and maps

-  Five calculated fields created
## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
The project goals include:
1.  Visualize the global burden of tuberculosis between 1990 and 2013
2.  What are the absolute prevalence/incidence/mortality rates per country per year? Which countries/regions have the highest disease burden?
3.  Are these rates the same if actual population densities of these countries are considered?
4.  What is the relationship between case detection rates and tuberculosis burden?
5.  What is the burden of HIV/TB co-infection?

## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

1. Created new fields to 'rank unique' the incidence, prevalence and mortality rates per year grouped by country/territories
2. Mapped the global burden of TB (in 100,000 population) over space and time
3. Plotted a linear regression model between case detection rates and TB burden.

## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)
