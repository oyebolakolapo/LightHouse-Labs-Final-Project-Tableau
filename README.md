# Project-Tableau
- This dataset estimates the global prevalence and mortality of tuberculosis between 1990 and 2013. Option IV
  
- The dataset (a .csv) file has nine dimension values and 41 measures

- The datatypes include strings and maps

-  Five calculated fields created
## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
The project goals include:
1.  Visualize the global burden of tuberculosis between 1990 and 2013
2.  What are the absolute prevalence/incidence/mortality rates per country per year? Which countries/regions have the highest disease burden?
3.  Are these rates the same if actual population densities of these countries are considered?
4.  What is the relationship between case detection rates and tuberculosis burden?
5.  What is the burden of HIV/TB co-infection?

## Process

1. Created new fields to 'rank unique' the incidence, prevalence and mortality rates per year grouped by country/territories
2. Mapped the global burden of TB (in 100,000 population) over space and time
3. Plotted a linear regression model between case detection rates vs TB burden.

## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)

1. TB is almost globally spread: I used a map to represent each country
2. Decline in TB-associated prevalence/mortality/new cases: This was represented using line graphs
3. Increased global attention on TB control in AFR and SEA where disease burden is highest
4. HIV/TB comorbidity is declining: This was represented with line graphs with a three-year forecast.
5. Case detection  rate inversely proportional to TB prevalence: This was represented using scatter plots and linear regression model


## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
More time needed to explore more visualizations

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
Dissect methods used to derive incidence, prevalence and mortality estimates of TB
